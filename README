A free Clojure workshop will be run by MFUG and clj-melb on Saturday the 23rd
of March. Thoughtworks will kindly host at their offices on level 14, 303
Collins St. We will begin at 10am and finish at 5pm. Please bring your own
laptop.

The premisis will be locked on the weekend. Give me a call on 0438 050 887 and
I'll come and let you in.

The format of the day will be:

- Get everyone set up
- Introduce the language basics
- Have everyone solve a few problems
- Break for lunch
- Introduce some more advanced features
- Have everyone work on a program

Experience with some kind of programming is required. There will be several
experienced Clojurians on hand to help out in any way they can. If you can't
bring a laptop then contact me beforehand and I'll try to find someone to work
with you.

We would appreciate it if you could get your machine set up for clojure
development before the workshop. If everyone comes prepared we'll save a good
deal of time and be able to cover more. Please install Leiningen (1), it will
bring a version of Clojure down with it. Also I recommend either the Catnip (2)
editor or Eclipse (3) with the Counterclockwise plugin (4). Don't stress if
you're unable get setup, we'll help you out on the day.

If you have any questions or suggestions please email me at
workshop@logaan.net.
